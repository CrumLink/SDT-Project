# Vehicle Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a vehicle dataset. Our goal is to uncover insights into the used car market, focusing on aspects such as pricing, vehicle conditions, and features.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains information on over 50,000 used vehicle listings, with attributes like price, model year, odometer reading, and more. 

## Key Features of the Analysis
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: We focus on handling missing data and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Using Python's Pandas and visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, we delve into the dataset to extract meaningful patterns and trends.
- **Visualizations**: We include a variety of plots, such as histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, and box plots, to visually represent our findings and enhance understanding.
